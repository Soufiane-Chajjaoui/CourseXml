# XML (Extensible Markup Language)

## Overview

**XML (Extensible Markup Language)** is a versatile markup language designed to store and transport data. It provides a structured way to represent information in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is widely used in various domains for several reasons:

## Key Features and Use Cases:

### 1. **Extensibility:**
   - XML is highly extensible, allowing users to define their own markup languages and tags. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications and industries.

### 2. **Structured Data Representation:**
   - XML organizes data in a hierarchical and structured manner using tags, making it easy to represent complex data relationships.

### 3. **Platform-Independent:**
   - XML is platform-independent, making it suitable for data exchange between different systems and languages. It ensures interoperability in heterogeneous environments.

### 4. **Self-Descriptive:**
   - XML documents are self-descriptive. They include metadata about the data they contain, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand the structure and content.

### 5. **Text-Based Format:**
   - XML files are plain text files, making them readable and writable without the need for specialized tools. This simplicity contributes to human readability and ease of integration.
